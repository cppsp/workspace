workspace
=========

This is a special branch of cpoll_cppspx, a fork cpoll_cppsp

cpoll_cppspx seeks to be compatible with C++ and includes modules with latest modern system.

Welcome all those who are interested in this version / branch to contribute and share information.

Thanks!



note: if you're looking for cppsp, it's downloadable as a source tarball from https://sourceforge.net/projects/cpollcppsp/files/

all the code i've ever written since grade 11; also includes some forward-ported code from grades 8 and 9.

all source code in this repository are licensed under GPLv3 unless otherwise specified.

the workspace layout is currently quite messy; there are a lot of miscellaneous stuff, and projects I've never had time to work on.


the most interesting things and finished projects in there are:
  * cpoll - epoll based asynchronous socket I/O library
  * dedup - simple file deduplicator
  * tcpsdump - like tcpdump, but extracts tcp streams instead of individual packets
  * socketd - web server multiplexer/web application host
  * cppsp - C++ web application framework similar to ASP and PHP
  * fbdump - a simple facebook profile dumping program written in C# with mono+gtk#
  * js - originally intended as a collection of javascript tools; however, it currently contains a newer, scriptable version of fbdump rewritten entirely from scratch; the new fbdump program is entirely javascript controlled
  * jackfft - a JACK audio based FFT filtering application (similar to jamin, but with adjustable FFT size and much lower cpu consumption)
  * nc.xaxaxa.C - my own version of netcat

all of the above projects should be compilable and usable.
